  <p>Welcome. My name is Magnolia, and I'm a fourth year Design and Psychology double-major at the University of California, Davis. If you are reading this, you've located my unofficial, "official" portfolio, containing some of my <em>personal</em> work that I've completed entirely outside of the classroom setting. While classwork tends to demonstrate one's ability to follow rules and implement learned skills, I wanted to focus on pieces that truly reflected <em>me.</em></p>
