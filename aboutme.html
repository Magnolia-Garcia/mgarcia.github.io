  <p>Welcome. My name is Magnolia, and I'm a fourth year Design and Psychology double-major at the University of California, Davis. If you are reading this, you've located my unofficial, "official" portfolio, containing some of my <em>personal</em> work that I've completed entirely outside of the classroom setting. While classwork tends to demonstrate one's ability to follow rules and implement learned skills, I wanted to focus on pieces that truly reflected <em>me</em>, my interests, and my independent, creative capabilities. As a result, my portfolio contains several hand-drawn portraits--created with analog tools and hours worth of patience. My affinity for things hand-drawn is driven by a desire to express myself in (what I believe to be) the rawest form. If you see anything that interests or resignates with you, please do not hesitate to contact me. I am willing to create with or for all who would like to make this world a little more beautiful.</p>
  <p> Many thanks.</p>
