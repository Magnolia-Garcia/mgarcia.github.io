    <h1>History of Emoticons</h1>
  </header>
  <p>The emotion icon, also know as the “emoticon” is a representation of a facial expression, formed by various combinations of keyboard characters, and is used in electronic communications to convey the writer’s feelings or intended tone. The first emoticon [intentionally created] was made by Scott Fahlman, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University. The following is Dr. Fahlman’s message in which the first ‘humble smiley’ was utilized:</p>
<p class="par"> 19-Sep-82 11:44 Scott E Fahlman :-) <br>From: Scott E Fahlman</br>
<br>I propose that the following character sequence for joke markers:</br>
<br>:-)</br>
<br>Read it sideways. Actually, it is probably more economical to mark
things that are NOT jokes, given current trends. For this, use</br>
<br>:-(</br></p>

<p>Fahlman proposed a colon, hyphen and bracket as a way of conveying emotional meaning via plain text.It was at this moment in which he paved the way for a reliance on visual cues that is heavily practiced today.

<p>Not to be confused with the well-known “emoji,” emoticons can be created by anyone, using a keyboard, their fingers, and a vivid Imagination. The following are some clever examples of emoticons:</P>
