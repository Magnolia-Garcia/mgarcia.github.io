      <h2>Univeral?</h2>
      <p>
        Are emoticons universal? Here is the simple answer: no!
        To be truly universal, something must exist or be prevalent everywhere, and yes, that includes countries outside of the Western world. There are 195 countries total, and within those, there exist a vast amount of cultures—many of which we may easily be unaware of. Why is this note significant? Well, culture plays a huge role in the interpretation of things, including emoticons.</p>

        <p>What exactly is culture?
        Culture is a system of ideas and practices that are held common in a group of people who live in a particular place at a particular time. We see evidence of culture in that which is tangible and materialistic as well as in the intangible, such as subjective thought and even emotions! If we were to compare East and West cultures for examples, one would find that East cultures are more interdependent and are considered to be collectivist. West cultures, on the other hand, are more independent and are considered individualistic.  It has been found that the degree of individualism versus collectivism in these cultures relates to overall expressivity. Emotional control is more highly valued in East Asian cultures; the spontaneous expression of emotion is thought to risk disrupting social harmony, and is discouraged. By contrast, more spontaneous emotional repression is more highly valued in Western European cultures, steeped in the Romantic tradition, for it is a means by which individuals express their authentic selves.

        <p class="bottom">In terms of emoticons, East cultures would be less likely to utilize ones such as :-), :-D, or :-)), for two reasons. Aside from being the translation of very expressive emotions, this particular emoticon style is very Western. Characteristics of the Western style includes having eyes on the left, followed by a nose and mouth; additionally, more attention is paid to the mouth. The Eastern style of an emoticon, on the other hand, are vertical (i.e. (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ) and more attention is paid to the eyes. Studies have shown that, when presented cross-culturally, these differing emoticons were not intuitively understood by the other culture, demonstrating that these expressive texts aren’t, in fact, completely universal.
