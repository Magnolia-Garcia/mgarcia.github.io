      <h3>Story Ending One</h3>
      <p>Everything was different. I wonder what happened. He spoke differently, so monotonous. He walked without effort towards me. My name no longer rolled off his tongue so fluidly like it once did.
        Where was the charisma? Unless I reached for his hand, he wouldn't hold mine. He wouldn't look me in the eyes in the loving way he once did. Did my appearance change? He wouldn't laugh at the
        jokes we once shared. Had he replaced all of our memories? He wouldn't even bother telling me goodnight before falling asleep. Did he grow used to solidarity? One day he woke up and decided he
        was breaking up with me. My boyfriend returned from war and everything changed. I wish he still loved me.

      <h3>Story Ending Two</h3>
      <p>He had a different attitude and was a completely new person. Machismo exuded from him. An ugly confidence. His expectations were unfair and unreasonable. He tried to be manipulative and controlling.
        He tried to stop me from going out with friends and leaving the house. But I wouldn't allow it. This is not the man I fell in love with.
